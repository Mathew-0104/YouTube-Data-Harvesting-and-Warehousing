YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL, MongoDB and Streamlit
The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project involves the use of SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit to create a user-friendly application for retrieving, storing, and analyzing data from multiple YouTube channels. 
The project utilizes the Google API to retrieve a comprehensive range of information, including channel details, video statistics, and viewer engagement metrics.
The data is stored in a MongoDB database as a data lake and can be migrated to a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis. The application is built using Python, and the user interface is created using the Streamlit library.
The project offers flexibility, scalability, and data visualization capabilities, empowering users to gain insights from the vast amount of YouTube data available.
The technology stack used in this project includes Python, MySQL, MongoDB, and the Google Client Library. The approach involves setting up a Streamlit application, integrating with the YouTube API, storing data in a MongoDB data lake, migrating it to a SQL data warehouse, querying the data warehouse with SQL, and displaying the data in the Streamlit app.
The project offers features such as data export, report generation, and the ability to search and retrieve data from the SQL database using different options, including joining tables to get comprehensive channel details.
The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project provides a powerful tool for retrieving, storing, and analyzing YouTube channel and video data, and it is a valuable resource for those looking to work with YouTube data in a structured and efficient manner.
